# Activity Browser

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33026150/54299977-47a9f680-45bc-11e9-81c6-b99462f84d0b.png" width=100%/>

The **Activity Browser (AB) is an open source software for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** that builds on [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev).

### Some highlights

- **Fast LCA calculations**: for multiple reference flows, impact categories, and scenarios
- **A productivity tool for brightway**: model in brightway (python) and see the results in the AB or vice-versa
- **Advanced modeling:** Use parameters, scenarios (including prospective LCI databases from [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), uncertainties and our Graph Explorer
- **Advanced analyses:** Contribution analyses, Sankey Diagrams, Monte Carlo, and Global Sensitivity Analysis

# Installation

## Step-by-step guide
See our 
[Installation Guide](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/wiki/Getting-Started#installation-guide) 
wiki page for a step-by-step guide to installing Activity Browser.

## The quick way
You can install and start the activity-browser like this:

```bash
conda create -n ab -c conda-forge activity-browser
conda activate ab
activity-browser
```

wiki page to learn how to get started using Activity Browser.

# Plugins

| Plugins are not necessarily developed by Activity Browser maintainers. Below are listed plugins from people we trust but we do not check plugins code. **Use them at your own risk**. |
| The plugin system is still in development so keep in mind that things may change at any point.                                                                                        |

Since the `2.8 release` a plugin system has been added to the AB. Plugins are a flexible way to add new functionalities to the AB without modifying the software itself.

The plugin code has been designed and written by Remy le Calloch (supported by [G-SCOP laboratories](https://g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/en/laboratory/g-scop-laboratory)) with revisions from the AB-team.

## Installation

### detailed instructions

Every plugin's Github page (links are provided in the above table) should have a **Get this plugin** section with installation instructions.

### general instructions

Plugins are conda packages (like the Activity Browser). To add a plugin simply install it in your conda environment from the Anaconda repos.

_Nb: add `-c conda-forge` to the install command like below to avoid problems with dependencies._

Ex:

```
conda activate ab
conda install -c pan6ora -c conda-forge ab-plugin-notebook
```

## Usage

Once a new plugin is installed restart the Activity Browser.

### enabling a plugin

Plugins are enabled **per-project**. Simply open the plugin manager in the `Tools > Plugins` menu.

Close the plugin manager. New tabs should have appeared in the AB (each plugin can spawn one tab on each left/right panel).

### disabling a plugin

Disable a plugin the same way you activated it.

**:warning: Keep in mind that all data created by the plugin in a project could be erased when you disable it.**

## Development

The best place to start to create new plugins is the [plugin template](https://github.com/Pan6ora/activity-browser-plugin-template). Its code and README will help you to understand how to create a plugin.
